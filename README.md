## Backend

The backend of SkillStack is designed to handle various functionalities essential for a job portal. Below is an in-depth look at each component:

### User Authentication

We implemented a robust authentication system to ensure secure access:

- **Registration**: Users can create accounts as either developers or recruiters.
- **Login**: Authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to maintain secure sessions.
- **Authorization**: Middleware functions check user roles to grant appropriate access to resources.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Access Denied');

  try {
    const verified = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = verified;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid Token');
  }
}
```

### Job Management

Recruiters can manage job postings through the following features:

- **Create Job**: Add new job listings with detailed descriptions and requirements.
- **Update Job**: Modify existing job postings as needed.
- **Delete Job**: Remove job listings that are no longer active.
- **View Applications**: Review applications submitted by developers.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { Job } = require('../models/Job');

router.post('/create', async (req, res) => {
  const job = new Job({
    title: req.body.title,
    description: req.body.description,
    requirements: req.body.requirements,
    recruiter: req.user._id,
  });

  try {
    const savedJob = await job.save();
    res.status(201).send(savedJob);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send(err);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Application Tracking

Developers can apply for jobs and track their application status:

- **Apply for Job**: Submit applications to desired job postings.
- **View Application Status**: Monitor the progress of submitted applications (e.g., pending, reviewed, accepted).

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const applicationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  job: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Job',
    required: true,
  },
  applicant: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true,
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'reviewed', 'accepted', 'rejected'],
    default: 'pending',
  },
  appliedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

const Application = mongoose.model('Application', applicationSchema);

module.exports = { Application };
```

### Database Schemas

The MongoDB database is structured to efficiently manage users, jobs, and applications. Key schemas include:

- **User Schema**: Stores user information, including role (developer or recruiter), contact details, and hashed passwords.
- **Job Schema**: Contains job details such as title, description, requirements, and the recruiter who posted it.
- **Application Schema**: Tracks applications submitted by developers, linking them to both the job and the applicant, along with the current status.

## Frontend

The frontend of SkillStack is designed to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience.

### User Interface

- **Job Listings**: A dynamic job feed tailored to developers' preferences.
- **Forms and Modals**: User-friendly forms for registration, job creation, and application submission.
- **Responsiveness**: Optimized for seamless use across devices, ensuring accessibility on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### Current Progress

- **Authentication**: Login and registration forms integrated with the backend.
- **Job Browsing**: A functional interface for developers to view available job postings.
- **Role-based Views**: Separate pages for developers and recruiters, tailored to their respective roles.

### Future Enhancements

- **Developer Dashboard**: Personalized insights, including saved jobs, application tracking, and tailored job recommendations.
- **Recruiter Dashboard**: Tools for managing job postings and viewing application trends with analytics.
- **Advanced Search**: Filters based on skill sets, location, and salary ranges.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced UI features like drag-and-drop for job management and real-time updates for applications.
